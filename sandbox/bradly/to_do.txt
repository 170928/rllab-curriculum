A. Analogy
Test robustness. Make sure to shuffle target indexes etc. Also test on longer sequences.
Implement softmax attention over frames.
Move to reacher and try analogy there. Possibly using con-opt LQR for the expert.


B. Third Person
Pointmass and Reacher working with only images.
Then pointmass and reacher working on domain invariant images.
Then show that PR2 fails with images.

C. Robot arm reaching green ball with vision
This might be best left to Waj for now. Sadly, without the derivatives needed for the LQR controller it's
not clear this makes sense as a tractable problem for now.

Get shit working on cluster.
