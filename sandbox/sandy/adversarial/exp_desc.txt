exp000.py: Try out different FGSM adversaries (varied norm and epsilon),
           for Pong agent trained with train/exp013
exp001.py: Same as exp000.py, except with (slightly) more variation in rollouts
exp002.py: Visualize trained policy for Space Invaders, for debugging
exp003.py: Apply FGSM to multiple games (Chopper Command, Pong, Seaquest,
           Space Invaders) trained with TRPO.
exp006.py: Apply FGSM to multiple games (Chopper Command, Pong, Seaquest,
           Space Invaders) trained with A3C.
***All experiments after this have obs_min set correctly to 0, not -1***
exp009.py: EC2 practice run, applying FGSM to Seaquest, trained with TRPO, A3C,
           and DQN. (No transferability for now.)
exp010.py: EC2 run, applying FGSM to all four games, trained with TRPO, A3C, and
           DQN. (No transferability). Will use output from this run to select
           FGSM epsilons for each norm, when testing transferability.
exp011.py: EC2 run, applying FGSM to all four games, trained with TRPO, A3C, and
           DQN. With transferability.
exp012.py: Visualize interesting white-box rollouts for arXiv paper --> scrapped
exp012b.py: Visualize interesting white-box rollouts for arXiv paper.
            Forgot to save something in exp012.py
exp013.py: Visualize interesting *black-box* rollouts for arXiv paper. And redo
           the white-box rollouts, with correct epsilons.
exp014.py: EC2 run, applying FGSM to A3C LSTM policies, for all four games.
           With transferability.
