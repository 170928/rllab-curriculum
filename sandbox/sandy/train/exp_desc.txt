exp003.py: Exactly replicating Haoran's experiments on EC2 - same param settings
exp004.py: Same as exp003, except with my AtariEnv instead of Haoran's
exp005.py: Same as exp004, except with input size of 84x84 instead of 42x42

<from here on out, experiments use my own copy of ParallelGaussianConvBaseline
 since old version has problems with joblib.load>

exp006.py: Same as exp003 (Haoran's AtariEnv), except with max_start_nullops=0
           and correct_luminance = False
exp007.py: Same as exp003, except with correct_luminance = False
exp008.py: Same as exp003, except resizing with scipy instead of cv2
exp009.py: Same params as exp003, except with AtariEnvMinimal
           (tried to make Haoran's AtariEnv as similar to mine as possible)
exp010.py: Same params as exp003, but with my AtariEnv (fixed bug with imresize)
exp011.py: Same params as exp003, but with my AtariEnv (fixed bug with setting frameskip)
exp012.py: Same as exp011, but with 84x84 input images instead of 42x42
exp013.py: Same as exp011, but with 44x44 input images instead of 42x42
exp014.py: Same as exp013. Testing addition of persistent adv. examples to AtariEnv.
exp015.py: Same as exp013, but for Space Invaders instead of Pong.
           Trying both frameskip of 3 and 4.
exp016.py: Same as exp015, but with 84x84 input images instead of 44x44 (to make
           it easier to see enemy lasers), and with smaller batch size of 25000
           instead of 100000 - otherwise EC2 machine crashes
exp017.py: Same as exp016, but with Haoran's original AtariEnv instead of mine
           (as a sanity check)
exp018.py: Same as exp016, except trying both 84x84 inputs (and batch size 25000)
           and 44x44 inputs (batch size 100000). Increase number of iterations to
           2000. Running on five games: Pong, Space Invaders, Beamrider, Breakout,
           and Q*bert.
exp019.py: Same as exp018, except only with 44x44 inputs.
           Running on Chopper Command, Seaquest, and Skiing.
